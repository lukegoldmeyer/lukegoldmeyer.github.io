## Description

This photo was taken at Cars and Coffee on May 11, 2024 in Grapevine, TX. This is my favorite color on the G80 M3, as I believe it perfectly matches the kidney grilles and agressive lines of the car. I was not sure if this is a G80 M3 or G82 M4, as they look nearly identical from a dead front angle, but I believe this is the M3.

I greatly enjoy the look of the CSL style grilles with the blue cold-air intakes behind them.
